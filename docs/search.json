    "text": "Course: ENST/MRNE 222 Environmental Data Science Spring 2023\nClass time and location: Mondays and Wednesdays 8:05 - 9:20 Anne Arundel North 111\nLab time and location: Wednesdays 1:10 - 4:20 Anne Arundel West 209\nInstructor: Dr. Cassie Gurbisz (you’re welcome to call me Cassie)\nEmail: cbgurbisz@smcm.edu\nOffice hours: Tuesdays 11:00-1:00 Kent Hall 308\nWebsite: https://enst222.github.io/website/\n\n\nToday’s environmental challenges are increasingly complex and involve vast amounts of data. With technological advances that make environmental measurements cheaper and easier and open science tools that make data more accessible, the environmental field could even be described as “drowning in data.” In this course, students will learn how to use tools from statistics and computer science to gain insight from environmental data without “drowning” in it. We will draw practical real-world meaning from complex datasets by interpreting our analyses in the context of previous environmental or marine science coursework. Throughout the course, we will use literate programming and version control tools to ensure that our analyses are reproducible and accessible. We will do all of this using R, one of the most popular and in-demand statistical programming languages in the environmental and ecological fields.\n\n\n\nReadings: All of the readings and software in this class are free and publicly available. There are free online versions of all the textbooks, and R, RStudio, and GitHub are also free. Two information sources which we’ll use most frequently are:\n\nR 4 Data Science\nIntroduction to Modern Statistics\n\nHardware: You’ll need to bring a laptop to class and lab every day. Make sure to also bring a charger. If you don’t have a laptop, please talk with me so we can get you a loaner.\nSoftware: For computing, we’ll be using Posit Cloud (formerly RStudio Cloud), which lets you access RStudio and all of the packages we’ll need right from your browser. Although R and RStudio are freely available to download onto your computer, working from a central cloud version ensures that we spend our class time learning to code rather than trouble shooting software issues. All of your work should be done in our class Posit Cloud RStudio workspace. You should receive an email invite to join the workspace. You can also request to join using this link.\nI do recommend that you download R and RStudio onto your computer at some point during the semester since you won’t have access to our cloud workspace after the course ends. You might also want to get your computer connected to GitHub so you can ask for help if you run into any problems. happywithgitr.com has very good instructions - be sure to follow them carefully and don’t skip any steps.\n\n\n\nAt the completion of this course, students will be able to gain insight from environmental data reproducibly and collaboratively using modern programming tools and techniques.\nSpecific outcomes include being able to:\n\nvisualize environmental data using ggplot2\nwrangle and tidy data tables using dplyr functions to generate a suitable dataset for analysis\nuse functions and iterative programming to automate analysis tasks\ndefine research questions and hypotheses\nconstruct statistical models to quantify patterns and make predictions\ninterpret data in the context of prior knowledge in the environmental or marine science domains\ncommunicate results and document code using RMarkdown documents\nstore data and code using a clean and clear system of organization\nuse version control tools (Git and GitHub) to collaborate and share code\n\n\n\n\nThis is an “ungraded” course. I want you to focus on learning R and developing your quantitative reasoning skills without the stress of losing points over minor mistakes. Mistakes are inevitable in this type of course. In fact, making mistakes and fixing them is the best way to learn! Furthermore, research has shown that grading doesn’t improve learning and can sometimes even harm learning. Rather than submitting work to me “in exchange” for a letter or number grade, you will self-evaluate most of your assignments by comparing them to the provided solutions documents. In addition, your peers and I will provide qualitative feedback on your projects. This should help you think intentionally about what you’re learning, what you’re struggling with, and what you need to do to maximize your learning in the course. Hopefully, this will spark your inner motivation to do your best work. Brief learning reflections will be an important component of most assignments. Periodically throughout the semester, you will also submit more substantial learning reflections in which you give yourself a grade based on your progress in the course (since we still need to submit grades to the registrar at the end of the semester). We will meet individually at the end of the semester to discuss your overall progress. As the instructor, I have the final say in your grade. But I rarely find that changing a student’s self-assessed grade is necessary - I trust your judgment.\n\n\n\n\n\nOccasionally we will work on brief application exercises during class to practice new tools and concepts. These will be posted as assignments in our Posit Cloud workspace. When you open an assignment, Posit Cloud will make a copy for you. Your changes will be automatically saved and I’ll be able to see your work. If you miss class, I will not check that you have completed the application exercises - they are mostly for demonstration purposes. But it would be a good idea to go through any missed application exercises to see how the tools covered that day work.\n\n\n\nLabs afford us time to practice the concepts covered in class and work collaboratively on group projects. Some exercises will be relatively brief and can be completed during the designated lab time. Others will be more involved and may need to be finished for homework. Either way, lab assignments don’t need to be submitted until the following Wednesday before the next lab. That way, you will have time to collaborate further, clean things up, revise, etc. if needed.\nHowever, please be sure to complete lab assignments by the due date. At the beginning of each lab, I will typically post a solutions document for the previous lab assignment so you can self-evaluate your work and ask questions. If you do need to submit an assignment after the deadline, I ask that you not look at the solutions until you have completed the work. The labs are designed to help you learn, so you won’t be doing yourself any favors if you just copy the solutions!\n\n\n\nWhereas labs typically involve guided exercises to help you learn how to use a particular set of tools, we will have two take-home, open-book data challenges to assess your ability to use these tools without as much guidance. Think of the labs as riding a bike with training wheels and the data challenges as a way of demonstrating that you’re ready to ride on your own. These should initially be done individually without any help from your peers so that we can assess your individual progress. A few days after each challenge deadline, you will have time in class to compare answers with your peers and work through any lingering problems. Then, as with lab exercises, I’ll post a solutions document so that you can evaluate your own work and reflect on your progress.\n\n\n\nFinally, the course also includes two open-ended group projects to demonstrate that you can ask a meaningful research question and apply the tools you have been learning to answer it using real environmental data. Keeping with our biking metaphor, you’ll have the freedom to ride wherever you want to go, completely free of training wheels. You’ll identify a topic with which you’re familiar from previous coursework to ensure that you have the disciplinary grounding needed to interpret your analysis. You must complete the final projects and make substantial code contributions to your group’s work in order to pass this course.\n\n\n\nBecause this is an ungraded class, we will emphasize qualitative reflection to self-assess your learning. Most if not all of of your assignments will include a reflection component in which you think about what you learned through the assignment, what challenges you faced, etc. You will also write two more in-depth reflections during the semester to more broadly evaluate your progress in the course. It is very important that you put earnest effort into all of the reflections to show that you are thinking carefully about your learning in the absence of quantitative grades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is very important that you regularly attend class and lab. Everything we do builds on previously covered topics. So if you miss class or lab, you risk falling behind. I also know that life happens! If you need to miss class or lab, first make sure to communicate this with me. Then check the class schedule to see what you missed, review relevant slides and readings, and complete missed assignments on your own. If group-based project work took place, be sure to communicate with your team ASAP to come up with a plan for how you will contribute. Since this is an ungraded course, I will not automatically dock your grade due to absences. However, when you write your mid-semester and final learning reflections, you should carefully consider your attendance record - especially repeated absences - may have impacted your learning and, therefore, your grade.\nI am similarly flexible about late work. If you need an extra day or two to complete an assignment, just ask - it’s usually not a problem. However, you should think about the purpose of a particular due date and how a late submission will affect your learning. In the case of projects, a late submission might mean you will miss the opportunity to get feedback on your work. For assignments and data challenges, you might miss the chance to work collaboratively with your peers to solve stubborn data or coding challenges. You should take these learning opportunities into consideration before requesting an extension.\n\n\n\nSMCM has recently decreased the amount of time allocated to class meetings. To maintain the rigor of our 4-credit courses, students are expected to spend time outside of normal class meeting times engaging with course material. In this class, students can expect engaged learning to consist of coding exercises and collaborative group work completed during lab sessions.\n\n\n\nOffice hours are set times dedicated to students. This means that I will be in my office waiting for you to come by talk to me. If you have a straightforward coding question, it’s usually easiest to address during lab. Office hours are better if you want to talk privately, or you have a more in-depth coding question.\n\n\n\nA huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. This is one of the fabulous things about R. So unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you can - and should - make use of online resources. In fact, an important part of learning R is learning how to search the internet for coding solutions. With that being said, you should be mindful of the difference between applying an online solution to a coding problem and copying a complete analysis and calling it your own. While the former scenario helps you learn, the latter detracts from your learning and is considered plagiarism. I trust that you can distinguish between the two. Students should be familiar with the official SMCM academic policies as outlined in the Course Catalog. You may also read the Student Handbook To the Point to acquaint yourself with college guidelines and regulations.\n\n\n\n\nAccommodations and Accessibility: SMCM is committed to providing access to the learning and living experience to students with disabilities and disabling health conditions. If you have received a letter from the Office of Accessibility Services (OAS), which outlines the academic accommodations to which you are entitled to and you want those accommodations to apply to this course, you MUST share your letter and meet with me to review that letter. If you suspect that you have a learning or living need related to a disability or disabling health condition that could benefit from accommodations, you should contact the Office of Accessibility Services, who can help you learn more about how to proceed. Email: adasupport@smcm.edu\nThe Wellness Center: If you find yourself struggling with your mental or physical health this semester, please let me know. I am one of many people here at SMCM who care about you and your welfare. The Wellness Center (240-895-4289) provides numerous confidential health and counseling services including same day/next day connections to counseling by calling 240-895-4289 or emailing the Director at jljolly@smcm.edu. To learn more about Wellness Center Services please go to their webpage at https://www.smcm.edu/wellness/\nOffice of Student Support Services: The Office of Student Success Services (OS3) provides free tutoring services and academic coaching with professional staff and Peer Academic Success Strategies (PASS) Specialists. You may drop into the PASS office in 230 Glendening for walk-in appointments on Mondays 11:30-1:00 and Tuesdays 4:30 to 6:00. You can also email PASS@smcm.edu. For tutoring for a specific course, please email your request to tutoring@smcm.edu. For any other help call 240-895-4388 or email os3@smcm.edu.\nThe Writing and Speaking Center: Located on the first floor of the main Library, the Writing & Speaking Center offers free peer tutoring in writing and speaking. The peer tutors are students themselves, but they have completed extensive hands-on training to learn how to assist their peers at any step of the process (planning, drafting, or revising) for any writing or speaking assignment. The peer tutors will not make decisions about revision for you and will instead work collaboratively with you to discuss ideas and consider options so that you can choose how best to revise on your own. This collaborative approach is one of the best ways to help students develop their abilities because all writers and speakers need audiences—just ask the peer tutors, who often schedule tutorials with each other. To make an appointment, please visit www.smcm.edu/writingcenter and click the “Schedule an Appointment” button. If you have questions or need assistance, please contact Director Ben Click at baclick@smcm.edu.\nOffice of Title IX Compliance and Training: St. Mary’s College of Maryland is committed to helping create a safe and open learning environment for all students. If you (or someone you know) have experienced any form of sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, or stalking, know that help and support are available.\nThe College strongly encourages all community members to take action, seek support, and report incidents of sexual misconduct to the Title IX Office. Under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, I am required to disclose information about such misconduct to the Title IX Office. If you would like to talk to a confidential employee who does not have this reporting responsibility, you can contact SMCM Wellness Center or Health Services at (240) 895-4289.\nFor more information about reporting options and resources at St. Mary’s College of Maryland and the community, please visit the Office of Title IX Compliance and Training.",

    "text": "For Project 1, pick an environmental dataset on a topic you already know something about, ask a question, and answer it using data. For Project 2, also do some stats!\n\n\n\nThe CO2 case study is an example project to give you a sense of what constitutes a great final product. You can access the CO2 case study through this github repo or in the class R Studio Cloud workspace (lab-06-co2-case-study).\n\n\n\nThe goal of the projects is to apply the techniques we have covered in class to a novel dataset in a meaningful way. The mid-semester project should emphasize data wrangling, tidying, and visualization, and the end of semester project should additionally incorporate statistical modeling (bonus “points” if you use spatial data as well). For both projects, you will analyze any environmental dataset you’d like, with the one requirement that it be related to a topic with which you are already familiar. Data analysis is usually most powerful if you have expertise in a relevant topic area and can, therefore, ask questions and draw conclusions that are well-grounded in that disciplinary domain. So this is a good opportunity to apply previous coursework or experiences in a new, perhaps more quantitative context.\nYou don’t necessarily need to do an exhaustive data analysis (i.e., do not calculate every statistic or visualize every variable), but rather demonstrate that you are proficient at:\n\nasking meaningful questions and answering them through data analysis\nusing R and GitHub to code collaboratively\npresenting and interpreting your results using literate, reproducible programming (i.e., RMarkdown)\nfor project 2, using statistical analysis to draw more rigorous conclusions\n\nTo that end, you should focus on your research questions and work backwards from there. Think about what types of analysis and visualizations will help you answer your question and how your data need to be wrangled or tidied in order to complete those tasks. You’ll probably need to do some initial exploratory data analysis to get a sense of what types of questions you might ask. As you enter the analysis stage, you can stick to the packages we learned in class (tidyverse) or push yourself explore others if they will improve your analysis. Finally, give careful thought to how you communicate your analysis. Neatness, coherency, and clarity are all important.\nIf at any point you are having trouble, don’t hesitate to ask for help before it’s too late. The main reason we have a lab session is so you can work while I’m in the room to provide immediate assistance. Take advantage of it!\n\n\n\nIn order for you to have the greatest chance of success with this project it is important that you choose a manageable dataset. This means that the data should be readily accessible and large enough that multiple relationships can be explored. As such, your dataset should have at least 50 observations and between 10 to 20 variables (exceptions can be made but you must speak with me first). The dataset’s variables should include both categorical and numerical variables. If you are using a dataset that comes in a format that we haven’t encountered in class, make sure that you are able to load it into R as this can be tricky depending on the source. Please don’t reuse datasets we have already analyzed in class.\nBelow is a list of data repositories that might be of interest to browse. These are not all exclusively environmental data repositories, although some of them are. You’re not limited to these resources - you are welcome to identify your own datasets as well.\n\nTidyTuesday\nBikeshare data portal\nKaggle datasets\nAwesome public datasets\nHarvard Dataverse\nChesapeake Bay Program Data Hub\nUSGS National Water Information System\nUS EPA Toxic Release Inventory\nNSF Long Term Ecological Research Data Portal\nUS EPA Environmental Dataset Gateway\nNOAA National Centers for Environmental Information\n\n\n\n\nThese are group projects for a reason - they will force you to learn how to code collaboratively. Code conflicts are inevitable and indeed very annoying. But learning how to fix them is an important skill. Embrace the messiness and try not to get too frustrated - I am here to help. Googling error messages is usually helpful as well.\nIt should go without saying, but everyone needs to make significant code contributions to each project. Because we are using Git and GitHub, I can see each person’s commits, including what you did and when you did it. So it is very obvious if one person is doing most of the work, for example, or another person waited till the last minute to make a few sloppy contributions.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction (2 paragraphs)\nThe introduction should introduce your general research question and your data. In the first paragraph, provide background information to introduce the topic. You should do some research and cite relevant sources to provide context that is grounded in the literature. For example, if I wanted to know whether there was evidence of increasing hurricane intensity in the storms dataset we have previously worked with, I would briefly review the scientific literature on why and how we know hurricanes are becoming more intense. The topic should be something you’ve already researched in some way so that you have enough expertise to spend most of your time analyzing your data rather than reading about your topic.\nIn the second paragraph, state your research question and provide a brief overview of your dataset (where it came from, how it was collected, etc.).\nPlease cite references parenthetically using author-date format (author’s last name, year of publication) using any citation style you’d like. APA is generally straightforward.\nData (1-2 paragraphs)\nProvide a more detailed description of your dataset, including names of files (if you have more than one), number of observations, and names of files. Then use the skim() function to provide a detailed summary of each dataset. Be sure to place your data in the `/data` folder of your project GitHub repository.\nData analysis plan (2-4 paragraphs)\nThis section should include a brief description of - The outcome (response, Y) and predictor (explanatory, X) variables you will use to answer your question, if applicable - The comparison groups you will use, if applicable - Very preliminary exploratory data analysis, including summary statistics and visualizations, along with some explanation on how they help you learn more about your data - The method(s) that you believe will be useful in answering your question(s). - What results from these specific methods are needed to support your hypothesized answer?\nReferences cited Include a list of any references you cited. You can use any citation format you’d like as long as the citations are clean and consistent. If you’re not sure, APA is a straightforward default.\nREADME file\nThe README file is like the home page of a GitHub repository. This is an important component of reproducible data analysis - someone should be able to access your GitHub repo, quickly learn what you did and why you did it in the README, and then access your analysis. Your project template includes a README.md template file. You should add your project title and author names to the README template, then populate the “Executive summary” and “Data dictionary” sections.\n\n\n\nThe report will more or less follow the same format as the proposal, with some additional content to contextualize your topic and present your results.\nIntroduction (at least 3-4 paragraphs)\nThe content should be the same as your proposal introduction, but with an additional 1-2 paragraphs to expand on your background information. Please aim to cite 3-5 information sources.\nData (1-2 paragraphs)\nSame guidelines as the proposal.\nMethods (2-4 paragraphs)\nThis section should include a description of the methods you used and why these methods were the right approach for answering your research question(s). Include any packages you used and provide a citation for each package. Start with a general overview of your approach, and then fill in the details. You don’t necessarily need to describe every single function you used and line of code you wrote. Focus instead on the big picture: why and how you wrangled the data, created new variables, calculated data summaries, made comparisons, identified relationships and patterns, etc.\nResults and discussion (at least 3-4 paragraphs but more is ok)\nThis section should present and discuss the results of your data analysis with an emphasis on how each of your results helps you answer your research question(s). Whereas a typical scientific paper generally includes separate results and discussion sections, here we will combine them to make the report more interesting and readable. It needs to include narrative text as well as code output (i.e., figures, tables, etc.).\nYou should organize this section around each of your key findings. Be sure to explain what each visualization is illustrating and how the ways in which the data are presented help to address your question. Discuss why we might be seeing particular patterns, relationships, trends, differences, etc. This is where your domain knowledge comes in again - you need to have a good sense of the underlying phenomena that are represented by your data in order to develop well-founded explanations. You may find that it will be helpful to cite additional information sources to help contextualize your results, but it really depends on the dataset, so these additional citations are optional. Please also include a discussion of the limitations of your analysis, what you would do if you had more time, etc.\nReferences cited\nSame guidelines as the proposal.\nREADME summary\nMake sure to update your README.md file so that it reflects the content of your final report.\n\n\n\nThe following folders and files should be in your project repository:\n\nproposal.Rmd + proposal.md: Your proposal documents\nreport.Rmd + report.md: Your report documents\nREADME.md: your README file containing a project summary and metadata\n/data: folder containing your dataset(s) in CSV or RDS format\n\nYour repo should not contain any other files. You may find it useful to create some “scratch” files to do exploratory analysis or code testing outside of your project file. But these files should be removed from your final repository. Our goal is to create a clean, fully reproducible repository that could be made public. That means that only your final, well-documented work should be included.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion and data: The research question should be well-designed and the data should be relevant to the research question.\nMethods: Appropriate analytical methods should be used to address the research question.\nCreativity and critical thought: The project should be carefully designed and implemented, and limitations/shortcomings should be thoughtfully discussed.\nProfessional polish: The figures and writing should follow best practices (be free of errors, well-organized, polished, etc.).\nSyntax: The report should take advantage of R Markdown syntax to format for clarity (e.g., plain text, code chunks, bulleted lists, headings, embedded hyperlinks, inline code, etc.)\nTime management: The team should equitably distribute time spent on the project.\nCollaboration: The team should work as a cohesive unit to collaboratively complete the project. This involves good communication and defining clear expectations for each other.\nReproducibility: Entire analysis can be run by an independent user in a new R Studio session and README file contains a project summary and metadata description.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’re working in the same repo as your teammates now, so merge conflicts will happen and that’s fine. Commit and push often. And ask questions when stuck.\nEach team member should be contributing, both in terms of quality and quantity. Talk to me if you have any issues with this.\nSet aside time to work together and apart (physically).\nIn your knitted/rendered report file, your code should be hidden (use echo = FALSE in your code chunks) so that your document is neat and easy to read. However your document should include all of your code so that if I re-knit your R Markdown file I should be able to obtain the results you presented.\nMake sure to knit your final report, commit it, and then push to GitHub!",

    "text": "The goal of the projects is to apply the techniques we have covered in class to a novel dataset in a meaningful way. The mid-semester project should emphasize data wrangling, tidying, and visualization, and the end of semester project should additionally incorporate statistical modeling (bonus “points” if you use spatial data as well). For both projects, you will analyze any environmental dataset you’d like, with the one requirement that it be related to a topic with which you are already familiar. Data analysis is usually most powerful if you have expertise in a relevant topic area and can, therefore, ask questions and draw conclusions that are well-grounded in that disciplinary domain. So this is a good opportunity to apply previous coursework or experiences in a new, perhaps more quantitative context.\nYou don’t necessarily need to do an exhaustive data analysis (i.e., do not calculate every statistic or visualize every variable), but rather demonstrate that you are proficient at:\n\nasking meaningful questions and answering them through data analysis\nusing R and GitHub to code collaboratively\npresenting and interpreting your results using literate, reproducible programming (i.e., RMarkdown)\nfor project 2, using statistical analysis to draw more rigorous conclusions\n\nTo that end, you should focus on your research questions and work backwards from there. Think about what types of analysis and visualizations will help you answer your question and how your data need to be wrangled or tidied in order to complete those tasks. You’ll probably need to do some initial exploratory data analysis to get a sense of what types of questions you might ask. As you enter the analysis stage, you can stick to the packages we learned in class (tidyverse) or push yourself explore others if they will improve your analysis. Finally, give careful thought to how you communicate your analysis. Neatness, coherency, and clarity are all important.\nIf at any point you are having trouble, don’t hesitate to ask for help before it’s too late. The main reason we have a lab session is so you can work while I’m in the room to provide immediate assistance. Take advantage of it!",

To access documentation for the standard lm (linear model) function, for example, enter the command help(lm) or help(\"lm\"), or ?lm or ?\"lm\" (i.e., the quotes are optional).\nEach function help page follows the same format. They start with a brief DESCRIPTION of what the package does. The USAGE section shows the various arguments you need to specify when using the function - some will be required, some will be optional. ARGUMENTS very briefly describes each of the arguments that you need to specify. The DETAILS section varies, but the author of the function generally gives more details about the function.
